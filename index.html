            Sayang, thank you for everything. You came into my life so unexpectedly, and now, 
            I can't imagine a world without you. You don’t even realize how much your presence 
            means to me. Every single moment with you is a blessing, and I am endlessly grateful for you.
        </p>
        <p>
            Every day, I pray for your happiness, your health, and your future. No matter what
